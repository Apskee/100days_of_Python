#Goal of this excercise is to calculate the price user should pay depending on their height, age etc.
print("Welcome to the rollercoaster!")
#Declaring Variables
height = int(input("What is your height in cm? "))
bill = 0

##### SOLUTION #####
#First condition that needs to be met in order for next conditions to be asked
if height > 150:
    print("Great news, you can ride the rollercoaster!!")
    age = int(input("What is your age? "))
    #Other conditions to ask for user's age
    if age < 15:
        bill += 5
        print("Price is 5 euro")
    elif age < 18:
        bill += 7
        print("Price is 7 euro")
    elif age >= 45 and age <= 55:
        bill = 0
        print("You have a free ride!")
    else:
        bill += 10
        print("Price is 10 euro")
    photo = input("Would you also like to have a photon taken while on rollercoaster? Additional price is 2 euro, Y or N: ")
    #Last condition to determine if user wants a photo as well
    if photo == "Y":
        bill += 2
        print(f"You total bill is now {bill}.")
    else:
        print(f"Okay ! The total price will be {bill}.")
else:
    print("Sorry, you are too short to ride this rollercoaster.")


##### EXPLANATION #####
#Series of conditions are asked if the very first condition meeting the height is true. Depending on user's input bill  will be created. If first condition if false,
#program ends.
