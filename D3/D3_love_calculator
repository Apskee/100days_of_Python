#Goal is to calculate the "love score" using only names
print("Welcome to the Love Calculator!")
name1 = input("What is your name? \n")
name2 = input("What is their name? \n")

##### SOLUTION #####

#Variables
combined_name = name1 + name2
lower_case = combined_name.lower()

#Word true
t = lower_case.count("t")
r = lower_case.count("r")
u = lower_case.count("u")
e = lower_case.count("e")
true = t + r + u + e
#Word love
l = lower_case.count("l")
o = lower_case.count("o")
v = lower_case.count("v")
e = lower_case.count("e")
love = l + o + v + e

combined = str(true) + str(love)

#Interpretations
if int(combined) <= 10 or int(combined) >= 90:
    print(f"Your score is {combined}, you go together like coke and mentos.")
elif int(combined) <= 10 or int(combined) <=50:
    print(f"Your score is {combined}, you are alright together.")
else:
    print(f"Your score is {combined}.")


##### EXPLANATION #####
#To calculate the love score I had to ake both people's names and check for the number of times the letters in the word TRUE occurs. To check only once I concatanated both strings. 
#Then check for the number of times the letters in the word LOVE occurs. 
#Finally sum them together as a string to get the total score
