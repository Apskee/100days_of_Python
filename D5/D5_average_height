#Goal of this excercise is to use for loop to calculate average height of students.

#Asking for input (each entry separated by space)
student_heights = input("Input a list of student heights ").split()
for n in range(0, len(student_heights)):
  student_heights[n] = int(student_heights[n])


##### SOLUTION #####

#Declaring empty variables
total_height = 0 #Storing all heights into a variable
total_inputs = 0 #Storing how many times for loop ran

#For loop to calculate heights
for height in student_heights:
    total_height += height

#For loop to calculate number of entries
for student in student_heights:
    total_inputs += 1
    

#Calculating average
average = round(total_height / total_inputs)

#Printing the outcome
print(average)


##### EXPLANATION #####
#First I declared empty variable so I can store entries into them each them a for loop runs. Then I simply calculated average using numbers I got from the for loop.
