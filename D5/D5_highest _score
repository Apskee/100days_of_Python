#Goal of this excercise is to find the highest number using a for loop

#Asking for input
student_scores = input("Input a list of student scores ").split()
for n in range(0, len(student_scores)): 
  student_scores[n] = int(student_scores[n]) #Converting the list of strings into a list of integers
print(student_scores)


##### SOLUTION #####

#Creating empty variable
max = 0
#For loop to store highest number into an empty variable "max"
for score in student_scores:
    if score > max:
        max = score
#Printing the outcome
print(f"The highest score in the class is: {max}")


##### EXPLANATION #####
#First I asked for input, then created an empty variable that will store the highest number, for loop runs the loop and compares all the numbers inputted.
#Then I simply print out the highest number stored in varbiable "max".
